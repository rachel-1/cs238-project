'''
needs access to routes available
set of all active routes + current distribution of all arrival times of all future stops
probs some graph search
implicit graph â€”> no edges at first, generate them on the fly
position x_s(t)
goal x_g(t)
for all trips t, route R_t
define what info each vertex should have
vertex for start, goal
each vertex should be mutable (have timestamp) except maybe start and goal
at every t, distributions of arrival time gets updated
postition and time distribution
sometimes edges go out of existence as distributions are updated
curr: doing feasibility test to see if edges ok
